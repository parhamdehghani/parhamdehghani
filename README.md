Motivated to scrutinize the possibility of beyond standard model through working with collider signals. Specialized in phenomenological research on different scenarios of supersymmetry employing the simulation of the chosen signals as compared with the standard model data or existing LHC traces. Enthusiast to do expert-level analyses of simulated events in MadGraph and MadAnalysis. Motivated to incorporate gigantic data to disclose any hidden pattern with the use of different approaches of machine learning. Love to continuously learn ...Motivated to scrutinize the possibility of beyond standard model through working with collider signals.
